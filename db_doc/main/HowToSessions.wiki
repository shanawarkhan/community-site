#summary How to store sessions in memcached

Keep in mind that memcached _is a cache_ not a database. It is fast, but not reliable storage.

The standard practice is to store your session in your (partitioned / replicated / redundant) database system and then use memcached *as a cache*. When you update your session you update both the database and the cache. When you read, read first from memcached and if not found then from the database.

= Minimize the number of database updates =

If for example you need to update a timestamp on each request (or something else "less critical"), you can choose to only update memcached with the new data and a "last changed" timestamp. If you also keep track of the time of the last sync to the database you can have your system just sync the less critical data to the database every 5 minutes (or when "something critical" is saved anyway).

= PHP redundant sessions =

If you are using PECL memcached extension and want redundant sessions you should look at this thread:
