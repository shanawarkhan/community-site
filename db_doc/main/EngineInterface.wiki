1.  Introduction

1.1.  Conventions Used In This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].


2.  Data structures

2.1.  Error codes

   The engine interface defines the enum ENGINE_ERROR_CODE with the
   following valid error messages:

   ENGINE_SUCCESS      The command executed successfully
   ENGINE_KEY_ENOENT   The key does not exists
   ENGINE_KEY_EEXISTS  The key already exists
   ENGINE_ENOMEM       Could not allocate memory
   ENGINE_NOT_STORED   The item was not stored
   ENGINE_EINVAL       Invalid arguments
   ENGINE_ENOTSUP      The engine does not support this
   ENGINE_EWOULDBLOCK  This would cause the engine to block
   ENGINE_E2BIG        The data is too big for the engine

2.2.  struct item

   Each "key-value" pair stored in memcached is represented with an item
   structure in memcached:

   struct item

   typedef struct {
     rel_time_t exptime;
     uint32_t nbytes;
     uint32_t flags;
     uint16_t nkey;
     uint64_t cas_id;
     void* key;
     void* data;
   } item;

   exptime             When the item will expire (relative to process
                       startup)

Internet-Draft          Memcache Engine Interface           October 2008


   nbytes              The total size of the data (in bytes)
   flags               Flags associated with the item
   nkey                The total length of the key (in bytes)
   cas_id              The Data Version Check
   key                 Pointer to the key
   data                Pointer to the data

   NOTE: In previous versions of memcached the key and data was stored
   together with the item structure.  The motivation for abandoning this
   is that using a dedicated pointer allows us to store the metadata
   somewhere else than the actual data.

2.3.  Interface structure

   All communication with the storage engine will go through the engine
   interface structure.  This is defined as an extendible structure to
   allow future modifications and preserve binary backwards
   compatibility.

   struct engine_interface

   typedef struct engine_interface{
     uint64_t interface;
   } ENGINE_HANDLE;


3.  Create instance

   Each shared object providing an implementation of the storage
   interface must export the following function to allow memcached to
   create a handle to the storage interface:

   ENGINE_ERROR_CODE create_instance(uint64_t interface,
                                     ENGINE_HANDLE** handle);

   interface           The highest interface level the server supports
   handle              Where to store the interface handle


4.  Interface structure v. 1

   Engine interface version 1

   typedef struct engine_interface_v1 {
      struct engine_interface interface;
      uint32_t interface_level;
      const char* (*get_info)(struct engine_handle* handle);
      ENGINE_ERROR_CODE (*initialize)(struct engine_handle* handle,

4.1.  interface

   To preserve binary compatibility this member MUST be first in the
   structure.  An engine implementing this interface MUST set the
   interface member to the value 1.

4.2.  get_info

   Get information about this storage engine (to use in the version
   command).  The core server will NOT try to release the memory
   returned, so the engine SHOULD reuse this buffer to aviod memory
   leakage.

   const char* (*get_info)(struct engine_handle* handle);

   handle              Pointer to the engine

4.3.  initialize

   Called during initialization of memcached.  The engine should do all
   of its initalization in this routine.

   ENGINE_ERROR_CODE (*initialize)(struct engine_handle* handle,
                                   const char* config_str);

   handle              Pointer to the engine
   config_str          String containing configuration options

4.4.  destroy

   Called during shutdown of memcached.  The engine should release all
   resources and perform shutdown logic in this routine.

   void (*destroy)(struct engine_handle* handle);

   handle              Pointer to the engine

4.5.  item_allocate

   Allocate space to store an item.

   Delete an item.

                                    const void* cookie,

                       ENGINE_EWOULDBLOCK
   item                The item to delete

4.7.  item_release

   Release an item.  The core server will no longer reference the
   object, so the engine may release or modify it.

   void (*item_release)(struct engine_handle* handle, item* item);

   handle              Pointer to the engine
   item                The item to release

4.8.  get

   Get an item identified by a key

4.9.  get_stats

   Query the engine for statistics.  This function returns a pointer to
   a buffer with series of pipelined return packets.  Each packet
   represents a single row of stats.

                      const void *cookie,
                      int *buflen);

   handle              Pointer to the engine

   cookie              Cookie for the engine that MUST be provided as
                       the cookie in the callback to the server
   buflen              Size of the result that MUST be set in bytes

   An engine SHOULD NOT implement its own result serializer and instead
   use the provided callback function.  When allocating memory for the
   result buffer, make sure to take into account the 24 byte overhead
   per stat entry and the termination packet for the binary protocol.
   The termination packet is also 24 bytes.

   Details on the callback is as follows:

                       ENGINE_EWOULDBLOCK
   when                When to flush the cache (see the protocol spec)

4.13.  touch

   Set the last referenced time for an object

   ENGINE_ERROR_CODE (*touch)(struct engine_handle* handle,
                              const void* cookie,
                              item* item,

   item                The item to update
   newtime             The new time to use for the item


5.  Asynchronous interface

   An engine should return ENGINE_EWOULDBLOCK if it cannot return
   immediately from the request.  It may then perform all the operations
   it may want to in another thread, and call:

   void notify_io_complete(const void* cookie,
                           ENGINE_ERROR_CODE status);

   cookie              Cookie for the engine to use with
                       ENGINE_EWOULDBLOCK
   status              The status for the IO operation

   The memcached server will then retry the operation.


6.  Security Considerations

   Memcache has no authentication or security layers whatsoever.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that memcache be deployed strictly on closed, protected,
   back-end networks within a single data center, within a single
   cluster of servers, or even on a single host, providing shared
   caching for multiple applications.  Memcache MUST NOT be made
   available on a public network.

              Requirement Levels", BCP 14, RFC 2119, March 1997.
