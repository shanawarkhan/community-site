  I am a huge fan of memcached and we use it a lot on Plurk.
  <br/><br/>

      Should you cache?

  Should you use memcached? Should you just shard mysql more?
  <br/><br/>
  Memcached's popularity is expanding its use into some odd places. 
  It's becoming an authoritative datastore for some large sites, 
  and almost more importantly it's sneaking into the lowly web startup. 
  This is causing some discussion.

      Cache your sessions. Don't piss off your users

  I hope you're all enjoying the 1.2.6 stable release of memcached. 
  Don't want to hear no whining about it crashing!
  <br/><br/>
  One of the most common questions in memcached land is the ever 
  obnoxious "how do I put my sessions in memcached?". 
  The long standing answer is usually "you don't", or "carefully", 
  but people often walk the dark path instead. 
  Many libraries do this as well, although I've seen at least one which gets it.

      Installing Memcached from Source on CentOS 5 
  %img{:src => 'http://tbn0.google.com/images?q=tbn:4fi33HXx0UfzkM:http://forums.cacti.net/files/memcached_933.jpg'}

  This is a quick summary for this process so that 
  I can refer to it later on, 
  and hopefully someone will find it useful as well.
  <br/><br/>
  Memcached requires libevent to handle its network IO stuff. 
  The bundled libevent in the standard yum repository is old 
  so it's pretty useless. 
  The newer versions memcached runs on newer libevent library 
  so I ended up compiling libevent and memcached from the 
  latest stable sources.

      Memcached 1.2.5
  %img{:src => 'http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/66703879/3594'}

  This is absolutely the most awesome release of memcached ever, 
  and it has absolutely nothing to do with me being a patchmonkey for it.
  <br/><br/>
  Kudos to MySQL and Sun (like [info]krow) for jumping in on the fun.

      Memcached: When You Absolutely Positively Have to Get It To Scale the Next Day 
  %img{:src => 'http://www.smoothspan.com/img/BobJacketThumb.jpg'}

  Why should "Executives, Entrepreneurs, and other Digerati 
  who need to know about SaaS and Web 2.0" care about a piece of technology like memcached?  
  Because it just might save your bacon, that's why. 
  <br/><br/> 
  Suppose your team have just finished working feverishly to implement "Virus-a-Go-Go", 
  your new Facebook widget that is guaranteed to soar to the top of the charts.  
  You launch it, and sure enough you were right.  
  Zillions of hits are suddenly raining down on your new widget.
