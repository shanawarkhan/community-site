  Should you use memcached? Should you just shard mysql more?

  Memcached's popularity is expanding its use into some odd places. 
  It's becoming an authoritative datastore for some large sites, 
  and almost more importantly it's sneaking into the lowly web startup. 
  This is causing some discussion.

  This is a quick summary for this process so that 
  I can refer to it later on,

  Memcached requires libevent to handle its network IO stuff. 
  The bundled libevent in the standard yum repository is old 
  so it's pretty useless. 
  The newer versions memcached runs on newer libevent library 
  so I ended up compiling libevent and memcached from the 
  latest stable sources.
